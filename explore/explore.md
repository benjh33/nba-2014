# Overview of the 2013-2014 season
---

All the data were taken from [nba.com](nba.com) with the help of the `R` package, [`bbscrapeR`](https://github.com/cpsievert/bbscrapeR). The data represent 1185 of the 1230 regular season games, I can't account for the 45 missing games.

Below is a handy view for comparing relative performance between 3 to 6 teams. Philedelphia had a rough go last year.

At right is a scatterplot of season averages of basic shot statistics used in the models (though aggregated by game).
