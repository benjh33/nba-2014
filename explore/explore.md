# Overview of the 2013-2014 season
---

All the data were taken from [nba.com](nba.com) with the help of the `R` package, [`bbscrapeR`](https://github.com/cpsievert/bbscrapeR). The structure of this app roughly follows the example of the package [`radiant`](https://github.com/vnijs/radiant).

The data represent 1185 of the 1230 regular season games, I can't account for the 45 missing games.

At right is a scatterplot of season averages of basic shot statistics used in the models. (Figures in the predictive models are aggregated at game level.) Circles representing teams selected below are outlined in yellow. Values for the fill scale go from blue (low) to red (high).

Below is a handy view for comparing relative performance between 3 to 6 teams. Blue and red bars represent wins and losses, respectively. The length maps to the point margin. Philadelphia had a rough go last year.
